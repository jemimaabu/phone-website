// sigh okay so the flex display isn't aligning my items in the center and since I don't have any debugging tools (typing on my phone and all), I have to manually change properties till I figure out what the problem is. Which is great (read:gross)
// also, is this how to write a comment in CSS? You know, now that I think about it, I realize I included a comment inside the CSS rule declaration above and that's probably where my error is coming from so lemme take that out.

/** okay wait, I think this is how comments are written */
