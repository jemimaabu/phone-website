        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to my Phone Website</h2>
        <p>A website I'm building from scratch using only my mobile phone and Github.</p>
        <p>"Why?", you may ask.<br>Hahaha, good question.<br>Anyway.</p>

            I'm going to be documenting what I've found hardest about the process as I go along. So here it is:
            <li>I can't actually remember which meta tags I need to use anymore. I mean <em>yes</em> I could just google it but it's the point of the thing that counts.</li>
            <li>Indentation is <b>hard</b>. It's fine when it's just a couple of nests and all but when you get to the real mutli-layers, pressing the space bar so many times just gets tiring.</li>
            <li>Ugh, I have to close my own tags?! Like <i>manually</i>? By <em><b>myself</b></em>. Gross.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Okay, that's all the updates I have for now. I'll keep this going for a bit, see how far I can get.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-container">
          <ul>
            Today's lessons:
            <li>Apparently, Github can't quite decide what their mobile version editor should look like because it changes literally everyday</li>
            <li>It's much easier to remember closing tags if you close them first and fill the content in after</li>
            <li>Trying to maintain indentation after changing the code structure is super difficult so this all just looks a mess right now</li>
            <li>I know I'll have to get started on styling this at some point but the thought of writing CSS on a phone makes me want to chew my hair so we're going to put that off for a bit.</li>
          </ul>

            <li>I fixed the indentation (and a couple of closing tags) so yay. Am I just adding more content to put off having to style this? Maybe but lol whose going to stop me.</li>

            <li>I'll start working on the CSS (at some point... I've created the file!) but this is my 1000th commit so I'd just like to document it! Yay me!</li>

            <li>Ugh writing code on my phone is just as fun as I thought it would be. Which is to say, no fun at all.</li>
            <li>It would probably be easier to work on the CSS if I had a design in mind but lol, plan ahead? Me? Never.</li>

            <li>Hehe, I have <b>not</b> been consistent with this, at <i>all</i>. In my defense, I never said I would be. So there.</li>

        <div class="post-container">
          <ul>
            <li>I realized that Github doesn't track what device you make your commits from (and it would be kinda weird if it did) so there's no way of knowing if I'm actually typing this on my phone or not.<br>Luckily I'm not a liar so there ya go.</li>
