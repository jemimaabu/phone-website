        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <h2>And welcome to my Phone Website</h2>
        <p>A website I'm building from scratch using only my mobile phone and Github</p>
        <p>Why you may ask?<br>Hahaha, good question.<br>Anyway.</p>

            I'm going to be documenting what I've found hardest about the process as I go along. So here it is:
            <li>I can't actually remember which meta tags I need to use anymore. I mean <em>yes</em> I could just google it but it's the point of the thing that counts.</li>
            <li>Indentation is <b>hard</b>. It's fine when it's just a couple of nests and all but when you get to the real mutli-layers, pressing the space bar so many times just gets tiring.</li>
            <li>Ugh, I have to close my own tags?! Like <i>manually</i>? By <em><b>myself</b></em>. Gross.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Okay, that's all the updates I have for now. I'll keep this going for a bit, see how far I can get.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-container">
          <ul>
            Today's lessons:
            <li>Apparently, Github can't quite decide what their mobile version editor should look like because it changes literally everyday</li>
            <li>It's much easier to remember closing tags if you close them first and fill the content in after</li>
            <li>Trying to maintain indentation after changing the code structure is super difficult so this all just looks a mess right now</li>
            <li>I know I'll have to get started on styling this at some point but the thought of writing CSS on a phone makes me want to chew my hair so we're going to put that off for a bit.</li
          </ul>

            <li>I fixed the indentation (and a couple of closing tags) so yay. Am I just adding more content to put off having to style this? Maybe but lol whose going to stop me.</li>
