    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>And welcome to my Phone Website</h2>
    <p>A website I'm building from scratch using only my mobile phone and Github</p>
    <p>Why you may ask?<br>Hahaha, good question.<br>Anyway.<p>
    <ul>
      I'm going to be documenting what I've found hardest about the process as I go along. So here it is:
        <li>I can't actually remember which meta tags I need to use anymore. I mean <em>yes</em> I could just google it but it's the point of the thing that counts.</li>
        <li>Indentation is <b>hard</b>. It's fine when it's just a couple of nests and all but when you get to the real mutli-layers, pressing the space bar so many times just gets tiring.</li>
        <li>Ugh, I have to close my own tags?! Like <i>manually</i>? By <em><b>myself</b></em>. Gross.
    </ul>
    <p>Okay, that's all the updates I have for now. I'll keep this going for a bit, see how far I can get.
